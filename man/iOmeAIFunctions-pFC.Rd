\title{iOmeAIFunctions: Penetrance Fold Change (pFC) Analysis}
\description{
The penetrance fold change (pFC) method detects true autoantibodies that differ
between two groups of interest and was specifically designed for small sample size analyses.
}
\details{
The detailed steps involved are:
\enumerate{
\item Generate a per-antigen baseline based on a reference group (e.g., for disease vs
healthy, "healthy" is set as baseline/reference group) using appropriately
normalized input data
\item For each antigen in each sample calculate fold changes based on the per-antigen
baseline value calculated in step 1
\item For each group being compared calculate per-antigen frequencies (penetrance
frequency) of samples that exceed an FC threshold relative to the per-antigen
baseline value calculated in step 1
\item For samples that exceed the pFC threshold defined in step 3, calculate â on a
per-antigen basis â the mean log2 intensity and the mean FC for each group of
interest (include in the final results table)
\item Using the frequencies calculated in step 3, perform Fisher's exact testing on a
per-antigen basis, comparing groups of interest
\item Optionally determine antigens that are associated with PSA status by linear
modeling and report PSA-associated antigens in the final results table
