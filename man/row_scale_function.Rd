\title{Row-Center Expression Matrix}
\usage{
row_scale_function(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Numeric matrix.  Expression data with features in rows and samples
in columns.  Typically from \code{Biobase::exprs(ExpressionSet)}.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{m}, with each row centered
to have a mean of zero.  Column and row names are preserved.
}
\description{
Centers each row (feature) of an expression matrix by subtracting the row mean.
This removes baseline differences between features while preserving relative
sample-to-sample variation.
}
\details{
Row centering is performed by:
\enumerate{
\item Transposing the matrix so rows become columns
\item Using \code{scale()} with \code{center = TRUE} and \code{scale = FALSE}
\item Transposing back to original orientation
}

This transformation:
\itemize{
\item Removes baseline expression differences between features
\item Preserves relative expression patterns across samples
\item Does NOT scale by standard deviation (no normalization)
\item Maintains the original matrix dimensions and names
}

Row centering is commonly used before distance calculations in batch effect
analysis, as it focuses on expression patterns rather than absolute levels.

\dontrun{
# Using ExpressionSet
library(Biobase)
data(sample_ExpressionSet)

m <- exprs(sample_ExpressionSet)

# Row-center the data
m_centered <- row_scale_function(m)

# Verify centering: row means should be ~0
rowMeans(m_centered)

# Compare original vs centered
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(rowMeans(m), main = "Original Row Means")
hist(rowMeans(m_centered), main = "Centered Row Means")
}

\code{\link[base]{scale}} for the underlying centering operation
