\title{NCF Threshold Filtering Function}
\usage{
NCF_threshold(input_data, df_ZZ, threshold, percentage = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A data frame or matrix containing the original input feature data (with row names as feature IDs).}

\item{df_ZZ}{A data frame with at least two columns: \code{feature} and \code{correlation}, representing correlation of each feature with a reference.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric correlation cutoff (only used if \code{percentage = FALSE}).}

\item{percentage}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, select the bottom one-third least-correlated features instead of applying a fixed threshold.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{df_ZZ}{The filtered correlation table.}
\item{ncf_list}{A list with \code{keep} and \code{junk} feature vectors.}
\item{threshold}{The numeric threshold used (if applicable).}
\item{comment}{A summary string of the filtering result.}
\item{cut_count}{The number of features retained.}
}
\description{
Filters features (typically antibody signals) based on their correlation with a reference signal (e.g., \code{ZZ_con2})
using either a fixed correlation \code{threshold} or by selecting the bottom one-third if \code{percentage = TRUE}.
