\usage{
TR_Protein_CV_function(
  TR_df,
  feature_column = "Protein",
  data_column = "value",
  cv_cutoff = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{TR_df}{Dataframe containing the data to analyze.}

\item{feature_column}{Character string indicating the column name to group features by (default: \code{'Protein'}).}

\item{data_column}{Character string indicating the column name containing the numeric values to calculate CV (default: \code{'value'}).}

\item{cv_cutoff}{Numeric value indicating the cutoff for labeling features with high CV (default: \code{10}).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{cv_df}{Dataframe with calculated mean, standard deviation, and CV for each feature.}
\item{plot}{ggplot object representing a scatter plot of mean vs. CV, labeled for features exceeding the CV cutoff.}
}
}
\description{
Generates a scatter plot and histogram to visualize the coefficient of variation (CV)
for each protein (or specified feature) from a provided dataframe.
}
\details{
CV is calculated as \(\frac{sd}{mean} \times 100\).

The plot includes:
\itemize{
\item A scatter plot showing mean vs. CV.
\item A horizontal dashed line indicating the CV cutoff.
\item Labels identifying features exceeding the CV cutoff.
}

Requires the \code{ggrepel} package for label repulsion in the plot.
